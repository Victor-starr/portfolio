## Overview

This project is a modern web application built using `React` and `Vite`. It provides a minimal and efficient setup for developing React applications with Hot Module Replacement (HMR), SASS for styling, and ESLint for code quality assurance.

## Features

- **Fast Development with Vite**: Instant server start and fast HMR for seamless development experience.
- **Hot Module Replacement (HMR)**: Instantly update modules without a full page reload.
- **Linting with ESLint**: Ensures code quality and consistency.
- **Fast Refresh using Babel or SWC**: Fast and reliable module updates during development.
- **Styling with SASS**: Use advanced CSS features through SASS preprocessing.

## Languages and Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Primary programming language.
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A fast build tool and development server.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing JavaScript issues.
- **Babel**: A JavaScript compiler for transpiling and optimizing code.
- **SWC**: A super-fast JavaScript and TypeScript compiler.
- **SASS**: A CSS preprocessor that allows for variables, nested rules, and more.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (version 6 or higher) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Victor-starr/portfolio.git
    cd portfolio
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server with Vite:

```sh
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application running.

### Building for Production

To create a production build, run:

```sh
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

The output will be in the `dist` directory.

## Available Scripts

- **`npm run dev` or `yarn dev`**: Starts the development server.
- **`npm run build` or `yarn build`**: Builds the app for production.
- **`npm run lint` or `yarn lint`**: Runs ESLint to check for code issues.
- **`npm run deploy` or `yarn deploy`**: Deploys the app to GitHub Pages.
